# ðŸš€ LeetCode Grind

This repository is my complete log of every LeetCode problem Iâ€™ve solved â€” and will continue solving â€” across all topics and difficulty levels. Itâ€™s my personal coding journal, built to track progress, store optimized Java solutions, and serve as a ready-to-revise library before interviews.  

Each problem is stored in a file or folder named `<problem-number>-<problem-title>` (for example: `1-two-sum/`, `20-valid-parentheses/`, `103-binary-tree-zigzag-level-order-traversal/`). Inside each, youâ€™ll find clean Java code, performance stats from LeetSync, and occasionally short explanations of the approach.  

The repository includes problems from arrays, strings, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, heaps, hash maps, dynamic programming, recursion, greedy algorithms, sliding window, binary search, backtracking, math, bit manipulation, and advanced patterns like tree serialization and graph traversal. My goal is to make this a single place where I can track my problem-solving journey, review patterns quickly, and keep a personal reference of efficient coding approaches.  

Hereâ€™s a small sample of problem stats:  

| # | Problem | Time (ms) | Memory (MB) |
|---|---------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | Two Sum | 2 | 45.1 |
| 20 | Valid Parentheses | 1 | 42.5 |
| 103 | Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal | 1 | 42.4 |
| 105 | Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal | 1 | 44.8 |
| 2646 | Kth Largest Sum in a Binary Tree | 47 | 66.9 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

All solutions are implemented in Java and synced using [LeetSync](https://github.com/LeetSync). While this is primarily my personal grind log, if you notice bugs, know a more optimal solution, or have suggestions for improvement, youâ€™re welcome to open an issue or submit a pull request.
